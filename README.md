# ERCfund
### An open-ended hedge fund implementation on the Ethereum blockchain for managing ERC20 tokens.

## What is ERCFund?

### Vision
Currently investing in a range of different cryptocurrencies requires a lot of technical knowledge. This has spawned the need for easy way to invest while reducing entry barriers. Multiple well-known and successful initiatives are on the market like Crypto20, ICONOMI, Melon, Grayscale, etc. 

However the sector of cryptocurrency investment is difficult to enter for smaller, independent investors who possess market knowledge and are experienced in traditional fields but simply lack the technical knowledge to offer a product in the cryptocurrency sector.

ERCFund strives to provide an safe, extensible implementation of a hedge fund for ERC20 tokens. Security and trust is immensly important for lesser known players. For this reason all parts of the fund are rigorously tested and reuse community-audited code from OpenZeppelin. Furthermore it provides the possibility to add external trust parties to the management team which can make prospective investors feel secure by preventing fund managers to mishandle their money.
